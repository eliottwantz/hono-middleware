OpenAPI with @sinclair/typebox for schema definition and validation

WHAT:
This is a wrapper class of Hono which supports OpenAPI using Typebox schemas. It is the equivalent
of `zod-openapi` but with Typebox schemas.

WHY:
Typebox is a great library for schema definition and validation. It supports JSON schema out of the
box and is easy to use.
